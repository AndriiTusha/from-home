			Japanese cars have long been the epitome of reliability and trustworthiness, but they haven’t always been beautiful to look at. Things have changed with the current generation of Japanese cars, which boast great design and more personality than ever, along with driving dynamics that can rival (and even best) the Germans in some cases.

				Japanese cars have long been the epitome of reliability and trustworthiness, with a couple of hiccups here and there (Nissan Pulsar NX, Toyota Paseo). However, they haven’t always been beautiful to look at, unless you’re talking about the original Acura NSX or the Datsun 280ZX. Things have changed with the current generation of Japanese cars, which boast great design and more personality than ever, along with driving dynamics that can rival (and even best) the Germans in some cases. Their bombproof reliability hasn’t been altered through the generations, either. Here are the ten best rising cars from the land of the rising sun.

			<h2>Subaru BRZ/Scion FR-S</h2>

				<p>
					<strong>Best Japanese Car for the Enthusiast:</strong> These superb sister cars offer up two of the best driving experiences out there, at any price. Subaru and Toyota have created a bargain $25k sports car that delivers handling and steering feels more expensive sports cars would kill for. The compact fastback-style coupe is a joy to look at, and 200 hp from its 4-cylinder boxer engine is plenty of power to get you moving. The fantastically stick sport seats are perfectly positioned for fast and flick-tastic driving. Okay, so the interior is a bit spartan when it comes to design and creature comforts, but you’ll be too busy grinning from ear-to-ear as you drift it around corners to care.

			<h2>Lexus IS350 F Sport</h2>

					<strong>Best Japanese Car for the Young Executive:</strong> It’s the sports sedan that makes BMW quiver in their brake shoes. Yes, the wholly new IS350 F Sport is fast, composed and supremely tractable. The mean F-Sport spindle grille is like a hungry mouth ready to consume its rivals, but the interior is outfitted for comfort as well as a sporting driving experience. The 306 hp 3.5-liter V6 is entirely potent, but what’s more important is the way the car handles. The beefier anti-roll bars, multi-link rear suspension and stiff chassis make for great carving partners, and the selectable Drive Mode is nutty good when moved to Sport Plus, which changes the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), adds steering weight, sharpens the throttle and remaps shift patters of the eight-speed automatic transmission. It’s a salute to the LF-CC car in the area of design and to the LFA supercar in terms of handling dynamics. Most of all, it’s a joy to drive.

			<h2>Honda Accord Hybrid</h2>

				<p>
					<strong>Best Japanese Car for the Long Commuter:</strong> The venerable Accord has always been a top notch choice for families, largely due to its practicality, reliability and easy driving feel. This generation gives it not only a bit more personality but also an option to go with a mile-eating hybrid that gets 50 mpg city thanks to its three drive modes. It runs on pure electric, hybrid drive and engine drive, shifting effortlessly and automatically depending on driving style and conditions. Even in pure gas mode, the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is a bastion of efficiency and smoothness. Plus, it’s got all the benefits of the big family sedan to go along with shockingly good fuel economy. Why on earth would you drive one of those other hybrids that looks like a lozenge on wheels?

			<h2>Mazda6</h2>
			<div class="container-fluid d-flex flex-column mb-3">

				<p>
					<strong>Best Japanese Car for the Family Man:</strong> You know how we feel about this car from the GP100. It’s not just one of the best cars from Japan, it’s one of the best cars, period. The looks alone — big fenders, a sleek greenhouse and the face a mother and everybody else would love — are enticing. The 184 hp, 2.5-liter SkyActiv engine is smooth and performs especially well with the available six-speed manual transmission, which shifts like a sports car. It’s big enough to hold your family yet drives like a car that shouldn’t care about them; great steering and handling round out a car that has no business being called a family sedan. The small Japanese company has clearly kicked this one straight through the uprights. Just wait for the torquey diesel, and you’ll see us grinning even more.

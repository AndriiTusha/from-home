			Each famous car brand dates back to at least 50-60 years, but most of them have been a part of global history for at least a century. This is why they are and will be hard to dethrone in an overall symbolic chart of best (or most famous) worldwide cars.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fierce competition may come from traditionally American Cadillac or Japanese Lexus, but the cradle of civilization still remains home to the world’s most renowned car brands. Sports cars (Aston Martin, McLaren, Maserati), limousines (S-Class from Mercedes) or highest class luxury cars (Phaeton Gold from Rolls Royce) are still to be found in Europe: Italy, Germany, Great Britain.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main European car brands list include Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Opel, Volkswagen in Germany, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari in Italy, Aston Martin, Bentley, Jaguar in Great Britain. France is the proud owner of Renault, Peugeot and Citroen, whereas smaller countries like Romania or the Czech Republic own the Dacia and the famous Skoda. Sweden is also renowned for high-quality brand Volvo.

		<h2 class="mt-2">GERMAN CARS</h2>
		<p>
			Many people say that, in order for a car to function for as long a time as possible, it must be German. Of course, not all German car brands enjoy the same outstanding reputation, but most of them do. Whoever has driven a BMW or has owned an Audi knows they’re into serious stuff. Expensive to maintain, but nonetheless serious. The same is true for costly Porsche or even Mercedes.

			<p class="text-center my-2">German Car Audi Coupe</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="mt-2">BRITISH CARS</h2>
		<p>
			Some of the main European sports cars are manufactured in Great Britain: Aston Martin and McLaren are two of the brands that people think of whenever they picture powerful sports cars. Elegant Jaguar is also of British descent, as are Bentley and Rolls Royce limousines. All these brands correspond to important European car manufacturers as well.

			<p class="text-center my-2">British Sedan</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Last, but not least, some of the world’s most appreciated SUV’s come from Land Rover: the masculine Range Rover and the newer, rather posh Range Rover Evoque are two of the models that sell impressively. British brands may not be as well-renowned worldwide as German car ones, but their quality is no less tangible.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mt-2">ITALIAN CARS</h2>
		<p>
			Although they don’t benefit from the same prestige as German or British cars, mass-produced Italian cars are an important part of the European car game.

			Car racing and Formula One worldwide would not have been the same without the involvement of Ferrari or Alfa Romeo, which were ultimately acquired by Fiat. This makes Fiat an important player in the traditional car manufacturing scene.
